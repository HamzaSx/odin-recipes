        <h2>A classic meal - Mexican style</h2>
        <p>My whole family loves this beefy lasagna flavored with taco seasoning. Even my picky five-year-old will eat it. Serve with shredded lettuce, fresh sliced tomatoes, olives and sour cream.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes with juice</li>
            <li>10 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 cup prepared salsa</li>
            <li>Â½ cup shredded Colby cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
